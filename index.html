		<h2>Last Christmas<br><small>Wham!</small></h2>
		<p>Last Christmas<br>
			I gave you my heart<br>
			But the very next day<br>
			You gave it away<br>
			This year<br>
			To save me from tears<br>
		I'll give it to someone special </p>
		<p>Once bitten and twice shy <br>
			I keep my distance <br>
			But you still catch my eye <br>
			Tell me baby <br>
			Do you recognize me? <br>
			Well <br>
			It's been a year <br>
			It doesn't surprise me
		</p>
		<p>I wrapped it up and sent it <br>
			With a note saying "I love you" <br>
			I meant it 
			Now I know what a fool I've been <br>
			But if you kissed me now <br>
		I know you'd fool me again </p>
